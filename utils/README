Convenient scripts to manipulate cx card parameters.

# To install: (Requires sudo to install)

sudo ./inst_scripts

inst_scripts = create simlinks to these scripts in /usr/bin.

To make the command list executable from anywhere on the system via symlinks

ls |xargs -I % bash -c 'ln -s `pwd`/% /usr/bin/%'

## Command Arguments

cx8fsc = set 8fsc sample rate mode.  1x crystal speed.

cx10fsc = set 10fsc sample rate mode. 1.25x crystal speed (only recommended when also using 16bit mode).

cx16bit = set cxadc to return unsigned 16 bit samples.

cx6off = set sixdb to off. This is a 6db gain setting for the AFE. Kind of like a "loud" button on your stereo.

cx6on = set sixdb to on.  (see above).

cx8bit = set cxadc to return unsigned 8 bit samples.

cxvx0 = set cxadc to work off vmux0

cxvx1 = set cxadc to work off vmux1

cxvx2 = set cxadc to work off vmux2

cxlvlcavdd.py = A capture script to use instead of `dd` that adjust the gain down automatically if clipping is detected during capture.
