Convenient scripts to manipulate cx card parameters.

To install:

sudo ./inst_scripts 

while in the 'utils' folder


cx10fsc = set 10fsc sample rate mode. 1.25x crystal speed (only recommended when aslo using 16bit mode).
cx16bit = set cxadc to return unsigned 16 bit samples.
cx6off = set sixdb to off. This is a 6db gain setting for the AFE. Kind of like a "loud" button on your stereo.
cx6on = set sixdb to on.  (see above).
cx8bit = set cxadc to return unsigned 8 bit samples.
cx8fsc = set 8fsc sample rate mode.  1x crystal speed.
cxvx0 = set cxadc to work off vmux0
cxvx1 = set cxadc to work off vmux1
cxvx2 = set cxadc to work off vmux2
cxlvlcavdd.py = A capture script to use instead of `dd` that adjust the gain down automatically if clipping is detected during capture. 
inst_scripts = create simlinks to these scripts in /usr/bin. Requires sudo to install.
